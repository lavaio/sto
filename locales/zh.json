		"one-content": "Lava Blockchain operates on Lava-Firestone, a Proof of Capacity (PoC)-based consensus mechanism. You prove to the network the storage capacity you hold, participate in the competition of block forging, and maintain the security and credibility of the whole decentralized network. As a permissionless and threshold-free consensus protocol, Lava enables you to participate in our consensus by contributing storage capacity wherever you are and whatever storage devices are in your hand. Lava is featured by such protocols of great openness that in return makes itself infinitely scalable.",
		"two-title": " Green Mining",
		"two-content": "PoC mining in Lava Blockchain does not consume electricity as in stereotypes. Rather, it relies on statically stored data, with no high-powered computing devices required. One percent of power consumption merely will be enough for PoC protocol network to achieve security equivalent to that of PoW. What is more, as PoW will inevitably go ASIC, which as a result weakens the degree of system decentralization. PoC protocol, however, has naturally bypassed such problems by working on mining blocks with storage devices.",
		"three-title": "Meaningful Storage",
		"three-content": "Lava Blockchain has all the way been refining and presenting a powerful consensus practice from global storage space and become a trust infrastructure for distributed social collaboration. But it doesn't stop there: Thanks to the growing maturity of cross-chain communication technology and the ever-increasing scale of distributed content-addressable storage networks, Lava can come with decentralized storage applications that help feed trust value into social value. In the future, Lava will in stages build a master protocol based on Layer 2 Embedment and Underlying Indexing, and support all distributed content-addressable storage networks to be embedded into the Lava mainchain in the form of Layer 2."
